Need:
Persistence. 
- Laptop space is scarce, so maybe just fetch video on-demand and store video source, w/optional 
  caching + lazy fetch.
- That's #1, 'cause otherwise iteration is hard and the corpus will stay light. 
  Last query recovered only 20 recent videos + tweets. 

Then, metadata and tags
- Media:
-- Video source (platform)

- Basic: 
-- Training vs Match

- Combo: 
-- Start time in video
-- End time in video
-- Attacking character
-- Defending character
-- Starter attack
-- Starter attack CH (yes/no)
-- Starter attack grounded (yes/no)
-- Starting stage position (midscreen, corner, close to corner)
-- Combo inputs (string)
-- Combo tips (array of text entries, for now)
-- Combo meter usage (type + amount)
